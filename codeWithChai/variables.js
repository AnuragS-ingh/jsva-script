// variables is the name of the memory space where the data is stored i.e it is the name of the memory location where the data is stored..

// In the latest version of the javaScript we have three different menthods for declearing the variable..

// There are three different keywords that is used to decleare the varable in the javaScript:-
/*
first is Declearing the variable using the "Const keyword":-

->The variable that is decleared using the const keyword cannot be changed throughout the code.Once it is decleared and assigned the value it 
is permenently assigned to that variable we cannot change the value of that variable throughout the code.

Now let's see some example of the decleration of the variable using the const:-
*/

const pi=3.14;  // Now the value of this variable cannot be changed because it is decleared using the const. We cannot assign another
// value to this variable


/*
Now second keyword we have is "var keyword":-
This is the another keyword that is used to decleare the variable. now a days var is not prefferd to use 
because of the issues in the block scope and the functional scope. For example:-

var nameOfTheStudent="Anurag singh";

The value of the above varable can be changed because it is decleared using the var keyword.
*/

/*
The third method that we have for declearing the variable is by using the "let keyword". This is the most preferable method 
for declearing variable. Let's see some example:-

let name="Anurag singh";
The value of this varable also can be changed.
*/

var Name="anurag singh";
let lastName="singh";
city="Barathawa";

// pi=4.25;//this is not allowed
Name="shitesh"
city="delhi";


console.table([pi,Name,lastName,city]);//This is the another method of using the console for printing the value of the multiple 
// variables is the tabuler form 

// Note: if we not assign any value to the variable then the js will return us undefined.****************
