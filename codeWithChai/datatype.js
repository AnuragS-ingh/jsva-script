// There are various datatypes in the javaScript and they are:-
/*

1.Number
2.String
3.Boolean
4.Null
5.undefined
6.symbol
7.objects
8.NAN(It stands for Not a Number)


If we want to check the data types of the variable or any value in that case we use our type of operator:-

(typeof variables_name or value)

lets see some of the  example:-

*/

let Name="Anurag singh";
console.log(typeof Name);// The required output of this line of the code is String.
console.log(typeof(Name));

console.log(typeof null); //The output of this line of code is Object..
